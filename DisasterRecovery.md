# AWS Disaster Recovery Plan

## 1. Identify Critical Components
The following components are critical to ensure the continuity and availability of the infrastructure:

- **VPC and Subnets**: The entire infrastructure is hosted within an AWS VPC with public and private subnets.
- **EC2 Instances**: Hosts the web servers. These instances are critical for running the application.
- **Load Balancer**: Ensures high availability by distributing traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
- **RDS Database**: Stores the application's persistent data, which is critical for operations.
- **NAT Gateway and Internet Gateway**: Required for internet access and routing in the VPC.

## 2. Backup Strategy

### EC2 Instances
- Create AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) of EC2 instances at regular intervals.
- Use AWS Backup to automate backups, including snapshots of the EBS volumes attached to the instances.
- Store these AMIs and snapshots in different regions (cross-region backups) for redundancy.

### RDS Database
- Enable automated backups and set a backup retention period (e.g., 7-30 days).
- Enable multi-AZ deployment for automatic failover in case of an availability zone failure.
- Take manual snapshots before major changes to ensure a specific point-in-time restore.

### Load Balancer
- Store the configuration of the load balancer in Terraform, enabling infrastructure re-creation as needed.
- Regularly back up Terraform state files in an S3 bucket with versioning enabled.

## 3. High Availability Setup

### Multi-AZ Deployment
- Deploy EC2 instances and RDS databases across multiple availability zones (AZs) for fault tolerance in case of an AZ outage.

### Auto Scaling
- Implement Auto Scaling for EC2 instances to automatically replace unhealthy instances and scale based on traffic. This ensures web layer availability during traffic spikes or failures.

### Cross-Region Replication
- Enable cross-region replication for critical data stored in S3 buckets (e.g., backups, Terraform state files). This helps with restoring from replicated data in case of a region-wide outage.

## 4. Failover Mechanisms

### Route 53 for DNS Failover
- Configure Route 53 for DNS routing with health checks. If the primary region fails, Route 53 can automatically route traffic to a disaster recovery region.
- Set up a secondary ALB (Application Load Balancer) in the disaster recovery region to handle failover traffic.

### Multi-Region Failover
- Replicate critical components (EC2 instances, RDS databases) in another region. 
- Use Terraform to deploy an identical stack in the disaster recovery region. In case of a regional outage, switch to the backup region.

## 5. Example: Multi-Region Setup Using Terraform

Below is an example of how to modify your infrastructure to support a disaster recovery region using Terraform:

```hcl
# Primary Region Setup
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Secondary Region Setup (Disaster Recovery)
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "backup"
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Replicate critical components in the disaster recovery region
resource "aws_vpc" "dr_main" {
  provider   = aws.backup
  cidr_block = "10.1.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_instance" "dr_web" {
  provider      = aws.backup
  count         = 2
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Same AMI as primary region
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public[*].id  # Ensure you have public and private subnets in DR region
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.web_sg.id]
}

# Define similar resources for Load Balancer, NAT Gateway, RDS, etc. in the DR region.

#This plan outlines the necessary steps to ensure your AWS infrastructure remains highly available and recoverable in case of a disaster. It covers backup strategies, high availability setups, and failover mechanisms
